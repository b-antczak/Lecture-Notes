\subsection*{CS 251 Midterm Prep for Winter 2017}
The following sections will be covered on the midterm:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Section 2.2} - Specifying input/output + truth tables (definitely truth tables on exam)
\item \textbf{Section 2.3} - Boolean Formulas + Algebra
\item \textbf{Section 2.4} - Two Level Rep (Represent a set of ANDs followed by an OR)
\item \textbf{Section 2.5} - Don't Cares
\item \textbf{Section 2.6} - Using gates and logic design + transistors (only short answer questions about transistors, don't 4 in nand gate, 6 in or gate. Don't study too much on this section)
\item \textbf{Section 2.7} - Extracting truth table from circuit
\item \textbf{Section 2.8} - Decoders (Not internals)
\item \textbf{Section 2.9} - Multiplexors (Not internals)
\item \textbf{Section 2.10} - Arrays of Logic Elements (slashes on the inputs and outputs) (need to be familiar with it)
\item \textbf{Section 2.12} - Clocks and Sequential Circuits (not a direct question, but you gotta know what's going on)
\item \textbf{Section 2.14} - D Flip-flip (there will be a question on it)
\item \textbf{Section 2.15} - Register Files
\item \textbf{Section 2.16} - RAM (short answer question)
\item \textbf{Section 2.18} - Finite State Machine
\item \textbf{Section 3.1} - MIPS word (not much needed to know, it contians 4 bytes)
\item \textbf{Section 3.3/3.4} - Unsigned/Signed Binary
\item \textbf{Section 3.5} - Two's Compliment
\item \textbf{Section 3.6} - Sign extension question (Short answer question, worth small amount of points)
\item \textbf{Section 3.7/3.8} - Addition/Logical Operators (maybe, Prof. Mann doesn't remember)
\item \textbf{Section 3.9} - ALU
\item \textbf{Section 3.11} - Converting Floating Point (you have to memorize the floating point format, not too difficult)
\end{itemize}
No questions on ROM, D-latch, or SR-latch, (99\% sure) tri-state, variations, characters, ASCII, unicode, multiplying digits.
\\
On assignments, review questions
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Assignment 1}: 1, 2, 4, 5 (not really, but it's worth studying)
\item \textbf{Assignment 2}: 1, 2, 3-6 (Be familiar with them), 8, 9
\end{itemize}
